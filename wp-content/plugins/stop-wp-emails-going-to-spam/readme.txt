== Description ==

Emails generated from within WordPress often end up in your spam or junk folder, This plugin helps you sort that out. The default settings of this plugin can often be enough to solve your problem.

When using the default PHP mailer in WordPress, especially on shared servers, emails will often be set to spam or junk by receiving email systems. This can be very frustrating and important notifications can be missed by you or your clients.

Why does this happen? One problem is the "envelope sender" not being set, and many hosts will recommend that you install a plugin to set the "envelope sender", this is the main purpose of this plugin.

Along with setting the "envelope sender" this plugin also displays your Sender Permitted From (SPF) and checks your server IP is in the SPF record, if there is one.

Optionally this plugin allows you to change the name and email address of the default WordPress notification email easily.

If you use an SMTP email plugin or use an API based transactional email plugin, this plugin will add no value; it is built to support the default PHP mailer only.

== Installation ==
